    "**<SPAN style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #C0C0C0\">Problem 4:</SPAN>** A classic problem when being introduced to probability is the Monty Hall problem. If you've ever seen \"Let's Make a Deal\" on television, this problem takes from that show. You're the contestant. The host of the show gives you three doors to choose from. Now the situation has upgraded. We have four doors , one door chosen at random holds a grand prize and the other three hold worthless items. You choose your door, and then the host reveals one of the doors you didn't choose such that it always holds a worthless item.  (If you initially choose the door with the grand prize, the host reveals either of the other doors with equal probability.) So now there are three doors left and the host asks you whether you would like to switch. What should you do?\n",
    "<ol><li>Write down your first reaction? Would you switch doors or keep the one you have? Why?</li>\n",
    "    <li>Create this scenario and simulate the strategy of sticking with the same door 1,000,000 times. What percentage of time did you win?</li>\n",
    "    <li>Simulate the strategy of switching doors 1,000,000 times. What percentage of time did you win?</li>\n",
    "    <li>Which strategy would you use now? Explain why this is the case.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simulation, you can simulate every step that happens in the actual game and exactly as it happens, even for very trivial steps. You can also clever-guess some parts and skip some trivial steps; if you do that, make sure you briefly reason about why you do so in comments, so that the graders know that you understand what actually happens in the game. There is no timing requirement for this problem.  "
