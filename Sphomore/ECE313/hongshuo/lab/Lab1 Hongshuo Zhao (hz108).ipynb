At this point in your academic careers you should have some knowledge of object oriented computer programming. It would certainly help if you've had experience with Python, but if not, have no fear. Python is a very intuitive programming language. If you've coded in C#, JAVA, or Matlab you should have no trouble learning Python. Before we get too far into the code, we present a few general notions of what the environment will look like."

    "\t\t\tThe computer you are using to read this file probably has installed on it the Jupyter Notebook App or similar application to read IPython version 4 notebooks.  We also assume the notebooks are run using Python version 3.7XX rather than version 2.7XX.  For more information on installation or using an engineering work station (EWS) Linux machine, see instructions on the course webpage. An IPython Notebook file (with extension .ipynb) is an accumulation of cells, each composed of either code or markdown (i.e., text). Each code cell is individually executable. Each markdown cell can contain (among many things) LaTex and HTML.   Throughout each lab you will be shown examples of code, probability theory, and coding applications. *You will need to be able modify this file to include your own answers and edits. Each of the questions is numbered in bold and we ask that you put all your responses/code in cells just after the stated questions.  Let's go over some of the basics:</p>\n",
    "\t\t<ol>\n",
    "\t\t\t<li>\n",
    "\t\t\t\t<strong>Running a Cell: </strong>While the file is running one cell has the focus. To run the cell that is the current focus you can press the play button in the toolbar or use the shortcut SHIFT-ENTER. You will notice it brings the focus to the next cell after it completes. To run and keep focus in the same cell, you can use CTRL-ENTER. The order the cells run in can be important. In these labs the order will always go from top to bottom. In order to run code in the middle of the lab you may need to have run the code in a cell prior to it.&nbsp;</li>\n",
    "\t\t\t<li>\n",
    "            \t<strong>Stopping a Cell:</strong>There may come times when a particular section of code is causing errors or running an infinite loop. You may need to interrupt the cell from running. To do this simply click the stop button in the toolbar or use the shortcut CTRL-C</li>\n",
    "\t\t\t<li>\n",
    "\t\t\t\t<strong>Creating a Cell:</strong> A new cell can be created using the Insert tab at the top of the page. It will default to be a code type. You can change the cell type of any cell by clicking on it and then using the Cell tab at the top of the page. For normal text, use the &quot;markdown&quot; type. It allows you to use HTML and LaTex as well.</li>\n",
    "\t\t\t<li>\n",
    "\t\t\t\t<strong>Clearing Output:</strong> If your screen becomes too busy, it may be useful to be able to clear output. This can be done again from the Cell tab under &quot;All Output&quot;. The program is still running, but has been reset.</li>\n",
    "\t\t\t<li>\n",
    "\t\t\t\t<strong>Saving Your File:</strong> There is an autosave that can be set to save your file at a given rate (default is to save once every two minutes). If you prefer saving on your own you can use the File tab or the CTRL-S shortcut. A handy feature, also under the File tab, is that you can revert to a previous saved checkpoint.</li>\n",
    "\t\t\t<li>\n",
    "\t\t\t\t<strong>Keyboard Shortcuts:</strong> It can be useful to learn the keyboard shortcuts for these. They allow you to insert cells, run code, clear code, at a much quicker a pace. The list can be displayed by typing Ctrl-m h, and can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/rel-1.1.0/interactive/notebook.html\">http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/rel-1.1.0/interactive/notebook.html</a></li>\n",
    "            <li>\n",
    "\t\t\t\t<strong>LaTex and Math:</strong> In these labs, you will be asked a number of questions, some requiring typed answers in a markdown cell, others requiring python answers in a code cell. It may be useful to learn LaTex to better explain yourself in mathematical terms. LaTex for the formulation of mathematical equations is very intuitive and can be picked up easily. For a reference, look here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Symbols\">https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Symbols</a></li>\n",

    "### **Part 1: Events and Set Operations**\n",
    "In probability theory, the **sample space** ($\\Omega$) is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. An **outcome** ($\\omega$) is an element of the sample space. An **event** is a subset of the sample space. For example, in the experiment of rolling a standard six-sided die, the sample space is $\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. The event \"the number rolled is less than or equal to 3\" can be represented by the set $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can perform set operations on events, such as **Union** (A $\\cup$ E, the logical \"OR\"), **Intersection** (A $\\cap$ E, the logical \"AND\"), and **Complement** ($E^c$, the logical \"NOT\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**De Morgan's Law** is a fundamental principle in set theory that describes the relationship between these operations:\n",
    "* $(A \\cup B)^c = A^c \\cap B^c$\n",
    "* $(A \\cap B)^c = A^c \\cup B^c$\n",

    "The theory of probability is built upon three fundamental axioms:\n",
    "1.  **Axiom 1 (Non-negativity):** For any event A, $P(A) \\ge 0$.\n",
    "2.  **Axiom 2 (Normalization):** $P(\\Omega) = 1$, the probability of the entire sample space is 1.\n",
    "3.  **Axiom 3 (Additivity):** For any sequence of mutually exclusive events $A_1, A_2, \\dots$, the probability of their union is the sum of their individual probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a finite sample space where all outcomes are **equally likely**, the probability of an event A can be calculated as:\n",
    "$P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|}$, where $|A|$ is the number of outcomes in event A (the cardinality of the set), and $|\\Omega|$ is the total number of outcomes in the sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Fundamental Principle of Counting:** If an experiment can be described as a sequence of two steps, with $m$ ways to perform the first step and $n$ ways to perform the second, then there are $m \\times n$ total possible outcomes. For example, when rolling two dice, there are $6 \\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes."
